Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Snail-bob-maker/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Snail-bob-maker
Snail bob maker is a free and open source level maker for the old flash game series, snail bob.

***

## About

See above. Snail Bob Maker is an expansion of the Snail bob flash game series that prominently features an advanced level editor. It has been rewritten in its native language (ActionScript) and also has plans to be ported to Python, C++, HTML5, Java, and more.

***
  
## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started on September 10th 2020 out of nostalgia for old flash games, Snail Bob being the one I became most nostalgic for today. The project was started on this day, but most of its foundation wasn't laid until the next day on September 11th 2020.

On September 11th 2020, the project received its foundation, including some starter source code, 2 songs from the original game series soundtrack, and directory creation.

### Alpha history

On 2021, August 25th, I got this project more up to date, adding a project language file, adding new x-text files (`AUTHORS` `COPYING` `CREDITS` `INSTALL`) and a makefile. The project was further updated the next day and was modernized further. A `README.md` file was created, along with a website.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
